functions for countering subject bias in behavioral training

This respository contains MATLAB code for countering subject-specific bias in behavioral training. It is intended to be used in behavioral neuroscience studies in which an animal subject is trained to associate specific stimuli with specific choices - the typical paradigm is two-alternative forced-choice, as outlined in [(Carandini and Churchland, 2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4105200/). Often, when being trained on these studies, subjects ignore the stimuli and make predictable patterns of choices instead - for instance, they may always choose to push one particular button, regardless of the stimulus. This prevents them from learning the stimulus-choice association. To solve this problem, one strategy is to take an adversarial approach: attempt to infer whether the subject is following a predictable strategy, and set future trials so that the subject will fail if it makes the predictable choice.

The antibias function provided here implements this adversarial approach. It attempts to predict the subjects' future choice based on previous choice history, and then sets up a future trial that will counteract any predictable strategy.
